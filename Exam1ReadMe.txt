Instructions:
When the game/build is first launched, the player needs to use the left and right arrow
keys to choose between two buttons. To confirm selection, the button needs to be a darker shade, then
the player can press their ENTER key. If the player selects QUIT, the game will close.
If the player selects PLAY, a count down will appear on the screen to indicate the game will start.
When the timer finishes, the player will be able to move a cloud and try to catch the falling stars. That
is how the player will earn points. Once the game timer has run out, it will end the game and display
the player's results. The game can be reset and played again, but a mouse input must be used 
to select buttons.
